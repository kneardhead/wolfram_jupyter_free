# wolfram_jupyter_free
**Aim**: Add Jupyter Files that are written in Wolfram Language, and some hack to install the system in machine for free.

### Background History and Links
I always brag about the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and Greatness of the GNU/Linux. Unfortunately I could not include Mathematica in the list, and this is such an important issue that I could not install Mathematica in my machine after changing to Linux. Just nothing made sense then, I love Wolfram Language and the Graph it plots.

The current website prices the full software for 165$ or something near, and I can't even afford if it costed a cent because this money transanction method for my native land to USA is not as simple as thought. Let go having a mastercard, I can't pay 165$ for anything in my machine.

I become desperate and google every other possible way starting from alternatives, but I want the Wolfram Language anyway. The emotion for Wolfram takes spark as my friend Sheikh asks for some ideas on Vector Calculus, having Wolfram would have made it so easy, I ended up scribbling online codes using numpy and other stuffs (which I don't understand, neither am interested too). 

Then I found this link, this link made the turn. Although the "notebook" for Mathematica was paid, the Wolfram Engine was, guess what, free! 

[Mathematica For Poor Undergraduates](https://www.davecwright.org/post/mathematica_jupyter/)

It makes the full point, I got a free license from the Wolfram Engine site and it is linux so thank god everything worked perfectly. 

Note, though, the above link makes use of "jupyter-lab" instead of just "jupyter notebook". I could not install the "jupyter-lab" for some reason I don't know, but the usual jupyter works fine. Here is the github to the program that fits in Wolfram into Jupyter Notebook (which can also be accessed by Visual Studio Code!)

The tutorial/instruction made by the link is fantastic and deserves award. I ain't exaggerating (spelling?). 

I am pleasantly satisfied finally having Wolfram Language in my machine. 

Good day, enjoy the codes.
